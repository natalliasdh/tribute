        <div id="tribute-info">

            <p>Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin was a Russian poet,
                playwright, and novelist who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of
                modern Russian literature.</p>
            <p>Critics consider many of his works masterpieces, such as the poem The Bronze Horseman and the drama The
                Stone Guest, a tale of the fall of Don Juan.
                His poetic short drama Mozart and Salieri (like The Stone Guest, one of the so-called four Little
                Tragedies, a collective characterization by Pushkin himself in 1830 letter to Pyotr Pletnyov)
                was the inspiration for Peter Shaffer's Amadeus as well as providing the libretto (almost verbatim) to
                Rimsky-Korsakov's opera Mozart and Salieri. Pushkin is also known for his short stories.
                In particular his cycle The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin, including "The Shot", were well
                received.
                Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel Eugene Onegin, which he wrote over the course of his life and
                which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels,
                follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.</p>
            <p>
                Onegin is a work of such complexity that, while only about a hundred pages long, translator Vladimir
                Nabokov needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English.
                Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers.
                Even so, Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers like Henry James.
                Pushkin wrote The Queen of Spades, which is included in Black Water, a collection of short stories of a
                fantastic nature by major writers, compiled by Alberto Manguel.</p>

            <p>Pushkin's works also provided fertile ground for Russian composers. Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila is the
                earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music.
                Tchaikovsky's operas Eugene Onegin (1879) and The Queen of Spades (La Dame de Pique, 1890)
                became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name.</p>
